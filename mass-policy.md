Privacy Policy Agreement

Mass Utilities:

Mass Utilities is a Discord Bot which prioritizes users' privacy. We understand the importance of data protection and aim to be transparent about how we collect and use data.

# Data Collection:

We collect data only if Moderators/Administrators enable functions within the bot that require data collection. For example, if Moderators/Administrators enable the AI Chatbot function, Mass Utilities will read messages to provide responses. The data collected is used solely for the purpose of enabling these functions and improving user experience.

# Deletion:

We respect users' privacy and provide mechanisms to delete collected data. Functions within Mass Utilities that require data will always include a disable/delete subcommand. Running these commands will effectively wipe any data associated with the functionality from our systems.

# Data Protection:

The developers of Mass Utilities prioritize data protection and take it very seriously. We adhere to industry best practices and continuously strive to enhance our data protection measures. Your trust is important to us, and safeguarding your data is a top priority.

This privacy policy agreement outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy while using Mass Utilities. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at discord.gg/SSSgNwEd72
