Mass Utilities is a Discord Bot which values users privacy!

Here at Mass Utilities we collect data only if Moderators/Admins enable functions inside of the bot that will collect information!

# Data 
* Mass will read messages depending on what functions the Mods/Admins have enabled (eg.AI Chatbot) and in order for the functions to work properly it will have to read and use the data.

# Deletion 
* Functions which require data will always have a disable/delete subcommand and running these commands will wipe any data regarding the functionality

# References - 
* Mass's developers value high on data and take data protection very seriously and it is a must have!
